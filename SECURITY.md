# Security Policy

## 🔐 Responsible Disclosure

This repository deals with **cryptographic and quantum security concepts**.

If you discover a vulnerability, flaw, or incorrect security assumption, please **do not open a public issue immediately**.

Instead, report it responsibly to the project maintainer via private communication.

Please include:

- Description of the issue
- Affected components or algorithms
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
- Potential impact on security or correctness
- Suggested mitigation (optional)

---

## 🛡 Scope of Security Concerns

Security issues may include:

- Incorrect QBER estimation
- Faulty error-correction logic
- Incorrect leakage accounting
- Privacy amplification weaknesses
- Unsafe randomness usage
- Insecure assumptions in protocol simulation

---

## 📦 Supported Versions

Only the **latest version** of the codebase is actively maintained.
Users are encouraged to update dependencies regularly.

---

## 🔍 Best Practices

When using or extending this project:

- Do not use simulated results for production cryptographic systems
- Treat this framework as **educational and research-oriented**
- Validate assumptions against peer-reviewed literature
- Avoid claiming unconditional security without formal proofs

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is intended for **simulation, research, and educational purposes only**.
It is **not a production-ready QKD implementation** and should not be used for real-world secure communications without rigorous validation.
